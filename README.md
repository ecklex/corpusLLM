# corpusLLM
a linguistic approach for analyzing huge text data with LLM

## Description
LLMs don´t seem to work for classic corpus linguistic tasks. You can certainly train the model with your data, but it won´t provide citing the data or search for a specific word frequency in trained text data. Therefore we create a database, import the data and let the LLM search through it.

## Requirements
This script will be tested in an Windows 10 WSL Environment, which is the Linux Kernel running on Ubuntu ... Running on native Linux Ubuntu should be no problem. Other Unix-Environment should also work, although it is not tested. No testing nor installation on native Windows intended.
